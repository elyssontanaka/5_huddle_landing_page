## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project was quite challenging for me. I tried to make the project responsive and follow the design preview at the same time, but I had I hard in doing so. The desktop background does not get quite right with display heights bigger than 800px. 

I also had to make a lot of adjustments and tweaks to make the social media icons to fit perfectly within the circles. I wonder if there's a better and easier way to do it.
